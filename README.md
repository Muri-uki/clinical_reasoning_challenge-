# clinical_reasoning_challenge-
In many parts of the world, frontline healthcare workers make life-or-death decisions under pressure, with limited resources and specialist support. This challenge takes you to the heart of Kenyan healthcare, where nurses working across diverse counties and health facility levels face real-world clinical cases every day.

In this challenge, you'll be given 400 authentic clinical prompts—each one a carefully crafted vignette combining a nurse’s background and a complex medical situation. Your task is to predict the clinician’s response to each scenario, replicating the reasoning of trained professionals as closely as possible.
